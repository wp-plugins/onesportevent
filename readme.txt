OneSport Event creates instant content for your web visitors to browse so they spend more time on your website and are more likely to come back.

== Description ==

Easily get event listings for sporting events and athletic or multisport type races (e.g. half marathons, swimming, cycling, orienteering, kayaking, ironman and triathlon etc) from your local region onto your own website.  

Events come from a free shared database which you can add and edit, and the plug-in allows you to specify your own CSS so you can have full control over the styling, branding and functionality.  The administration options allows you to customise which events are displayed and to enable/disable different user filtering functionality.

Features are

* Easy and instantly available.  Install the plug-in and events appear on your website instantly
* Flexible - configure which areas, event types and activities you want to see
* Always updated - as event organizers have one place to maintain events for multiple websites
* Event details - also drill through to specific event details, still on your website!
* Multiple filtering options - onroad, offroad, cycling, running, triathlon, you name it!
* Valid XHTML - Valid CSS based output works with all web browsers
* Club events - promote your club events for free on multiple web sites
* No data charges - content is served directly from the shared web server to your customer
* High performance - your website renders first and multiple connections allow parallel downloads
* Internet, MSN and telephone support, just drop me a line for my personal MSN
* Map integration - Coming soon! - drill through to see an events actual course route on the map

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do events get into the database? = 

Event organisers and clubs maintain the list of events in the shared database from http://www.onesportevent.com/promote-event.  If you want to add your own public or private event you can (although the adding event functionality is designed for event organisers and clubs and is not a full on event management system!).  None the less, and you have lot of flexibility including a full editor allowing you to use bolding, tables, layout, colours and pictures or maps in your event descriptions.

= What about my clubs events? = 

It can also be used for club-only race calendars so your members know information about your events - the best thing for clubs is it allow clubs to promote their events on other sites sharing the database, and thus gain more attention.

= Is there advertising in the plug in? = 

Nope.  But donations are welcomed.. encouraged even!

== Version History ==
= Version 2.0 =

Realised most people were stuggling to get version 1 working as you had to configure the an HTML placeholder in the right place on your site, and apologies, I didn't document how to do that well ;-)

Decided to automate the process so it is simple, let me know if your experience is anything less than perfect.

* Removed need to manually configure placeholders
* Add "create new event page" to automatically create a default page with your events
* Allow multiple event pages to be created
* Complely rebuilt onesportevent.com from ground up and improved documentation
* Improved performance of API several times, now very fast
* Adjusted API to allow more control over how events are displayed

= Version 1.0 =

* Created basic plug-in with configuration options.
* Pretty hard to use unless you know HTML - limited documentation but functional.
