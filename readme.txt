WordPress Plugin to display Sport events from OneSportEvent.com using their API.

== Description ==

The OneSportEvent plug-in allows you to easily get event listings for sporting events and race (e.g. half marathons, swimming, orienteering, kayaking etc) onto your own website.  It can also be used for club-only race calendars so your members know information about your events.
Events come from a free shared database which you can add and edit, and the plug-in gives you full control over the styling, branding and functionality using css and administration options.  This includes the ability to show certain event types by default or enable/disable different user filtering functionality.
When adding events at www.onesportevent.com you also have a lot of flexibility including a full editor allowing you to use bolding, tables, layout, colours and pictures or maps in your event descriptions - or even edit the raw HTML.
